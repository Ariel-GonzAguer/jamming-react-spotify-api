## Overview ☀️

Hola. This App was created as part of CodeCademy's Front End Engineer curriculum.
The main objective of the App is to allow users to search for songs within the Spotify catalog to create personalized playlists and save them in their personal account.


## Features 🎈

- Easy and simple connection with your Spotify profile.

- Look for anything! Just type what you want to listen to and Jammming will find it in the Spotify catalog. Do you want to listen to feline music? Just type "kittens" in the search engine!

- Choose the name that seems coolest to you for your playlist. How about Flying Tomatoes?

- Available for use on large, medium and small-medium screens.

- Did you get bored halfway through creating the playlist? Just click the Reset Playlist button and start again.
